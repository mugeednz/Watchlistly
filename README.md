# Watchlistly
A modern movie browser app developed in SwiftUI using the MVVM pattern. Watchlistly retrieves live movie data from the web and presents it through an elegant, minimalist interface. It demonstrates clean architecture principles, API integration, and reactive UI updates — a perfect showcase of SwiftUI’s power.
